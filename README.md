## Features

The app features a dynamic counting system, which means that it continuously updates the clicks-per-second count as the user clicks, allowing them to see their current clicking speed in real-time.
It also has an auto reset feature, which resets the count to zero after a certain amount of time has passed, allowing users to track their clicking speed over multiple sessions.
The app also includes a rate history, which stores and displays the user's best clicking speed, allowing them to track their progress and see how their clicking speed has changed.

This app is useful for those who want to improve their clicking speed and efficiency, and can be used for a variety of purposes such as gaming.
